# Blank syntax colorscheme for Sublime Text 3

A very simple light colorscheme to avoid distraction. Keeps all the goodness of Sublime without disabling all syntaxic features (go to def, etc.).

## Screenshot(s)

## How to use
Not available on the package manager because I'm lazy, but it's simple:
1. Go to *Preferences* > *Browse packages...*
2. Make a folder called "blank_syntax.tmTheme" (case is important)
3. Copy the .tmTheme file in it.
4. No need to restart Sublime, you can immediately do ^shift+p > *UI: Select Color Scheme* to select it.
5. Enjoy!

## Inspiration etc
* Plan9 and its culture (see ACME for example)
* Sean Barrett and his minimalistic environment, which allows for great focus. He uses a specific theme with green comments though
* Lazyness of looking for good light colorschemes for Sublime. A good one is the Mac Classic one.
* The font used in the screenshots is Consolas, the Theme is Default.
